After days of dedication and hard work, I’m thrilled to share my completed To-Do List Project for Task 1! This project involved multiple stages, from frontend design to implementing backend logic with CRUD operations and local storage to ensure data persistence.

Project Highlights:
  Frontend Design: Built a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to make the To-Do List visually appealing and user-friendly.
  
 Web Development: Added JavaScript functionality to enable seamless user interactions and task management.
 
  CRUD Operations: Fully implemented Create, Read, Delete, and Update operations, allowing users to effectively manage their tasks.
  
  Local Storage Integration: Ensured tasks remain saved, even after a browser refresh, for a better user experience.
  
  This project was a valuable experience, enhancing my skills in both design and development. I’m proud of the result and excited to apply these new skills to future projects.
